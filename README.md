# affinitymatrix

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `affinitymatrix` is to provide a set of tools to estimate
matching models without frictions and with Transferable Utility starting
from matched data. The package contains a set of functions to implement
the tools developed by Dupuy and Galichon (2014), Dupuy, Galichon and
Sun (2019) and Ciscato, Galichon and Gousse (2020).

  - `estimate.affinity.matrix` estimates the affinity matrix of the
    matching model of Dupuy and Galichon (2014), performs the saliency
    analysis and the rank tests. The user must supply a matched sample
    that is treated as the equilibrium matching of a bipartite
    one-to-one matching model without frictions and with Transferable
    Utility. For the sake of clarity, in the documentation we take the
    example of the marriage market and refer to 'men' as the
    observations on one side of the market and to 'women' as the
    observations on the other side. Other applications may include
    matching between CEOs and firms, firms and workers, buyers and
    sellers, etc. An example is provided below.

  - `estimate.affinity.matrix.lowrank` estimates the affinity matrix of
    the matching model of Dupuy and Galichon (2014) under a rank
    restriction on the affinity matrix, as suggested by Dupuy, Galichon
    and Sun (2019). In their own words, 'to accommodate high
    dimensionality of the data, they propose a novel method that
    incorporates a nuclear norm regularization which effectively
    enforces a rank constraint on the affinity matrix.' This function
    also performs the saliency analysis and the rank tests. This
    function is a potential alternative to `estimate.affinity.matrix`
    when the number of matching variables is low relatively to the
    number of observed matches or when the researcher believes that the
    number of dimensions of the matching problem is much lower than the
    number of observed variables considered.

  - `estimate.affinity.matrix.unipartite` estimates the affinity matrix
    of the matching model of Ciscato, Gousse and Galichon (2020),
    performs the saliency analysis and the rank tests. The model is
    called unipartite (otherwise known as the 'roommate problem') and
    differs from the original Dupuy and Galichon (2014) since all agents
    are pooled in one group and can match within the group. For the sake
    of clarity, in the documentation we take the example of the same-sex
    marriage market and refer to 'first partner' and 'second partner' in
    order to distinguish between the arbitrary partner order in a
    database (e.g., survey respondent and partner of the respondent).
    Note that in this case the variable 'sex' is treated as a matching
    variable rather than a criterion to assign partners to one side of
    the market as in the bipartite case. Other applications may include
    matching between coworkers, roommates or teammates.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `affinitymatrix` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("affinitymatrix") 
```

You can install the development version directly from
[Github](https://github.com/edoardociscato/affinitymatrix) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("edoardociscato/affinitymatrix")
```

## Example

The example below shows how to use the main function of the package,
`estimate.affinity.matrix`, and how to summarize its findings. We first
generate a random sample of *matches*: the values of the normalized
variance-covariance matrix used in the data generating process are taken
from Chiappori, Ciscato and Guerriero (2020). For the sake of clarity,
consider the marriage market example: every row of our data frame
corresponds to a couple. The first `Kx` columns correspond to the
husbands' characteristics, or *matching variables*, while the last `Ky`
columns correspond to the wives'. The key inputs to feed to
`estimate.affinity.matrix` are two matrices `X` and `Y` corresponding to
the husbands' and wives' traits and sorted so that the i-th man in `X`
is married to the i-th woman in `Y`.

``` r

# Parameters
Kx = 4; Ky = 4; # number of matching variables on both sides of the market
N = 100 # sample size
mu = rep(0, Kx+Ky) # means of the data generating process
Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.326, 0.1446, -0.0668, 0.5712, 0.4277, 0.1847, -0.2883, 0.326, 1, -0.0372, 0.0215, 0.2795, 0.8471, 0.1211, -0.0902, 0.1446, -0.0372, 1, -0.0244, 0.2186, 0.0636, 0.1489, -0.1301, -0.0668, 0.0215, -0.0244, 1, 0.0192, 0.0452, -0.0553, 0.2717, 0.5712, 0.2795, 0.2186, 0.0192, 1, 0.3309, 0.1324, -0.1896, 0.4277, 0.8471, 0.0636, 0.0452, 0.3309, 1, 0.0915, -0.1299, 0.1847, 0.1211, 0.1489, -0.0553, 0.1324, 0.0915, 1, -0.1959, -0.2883, -0.0902, -0.1301, 0.2717, -0.1896, -0.1299, -0.1959, 1),
               nrow=Kx+Ky) # (normalized) variance-covariance matrix of the data generating process
labels_x = c("Educ.", "Age", "Height", "BMI") # labels for men's matching variables
labels_y = c("Educ.", "Age", "Height", "BMI") # labels for women's matching variables

# Sample
data = MASS::mvrnorm(N, mu, Sigma) # generating sample
X = data[,1:Kx]; Y = data[,Kx+1:Ky] # men's and women's sample data
w = sort(runif(N-1)); w = c(w,1) - c(0,w) # sample weights

# Main estimation
res = estimate.affinity.matrix(X, Y, w = w, nB = 500)

The output of `estimate.affinity.matrix` is a list of objects that
constitute the estimation results. The estimated affinity matrix is
stored under `Aopt`, while the vector of loadings describing men's and
women's matching factors are stored under `U` and `V` respectively. The
following functions can be used to produce summaries of the different
findings. For further details, Chiappori, Ciscato and Guerriero (2020)
contain tables and plots that are generated with these functions.
