Description: The package implements tools to study sorting patterns in matching markets and allows the user to estimate the affinity matrix of both the bipartite one-to-one matching model without frictions and with Transferable Utility by Dupuy and Galichon (2014) and its unipartite variant by Ciscato, Galichon and Gousse (2020). It also contains all the necessary tools to implement the saliency analysis, to run rank tests of the affinity matrix and to build tables and plots summarizing the findings. The package contains an additional function to estimate a sparse affinity matrix where the rank restriction can be chosen through cross validation as suggested by Dupuy, Galichon and Sun (2019).
