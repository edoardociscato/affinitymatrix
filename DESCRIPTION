Description: Tools to study sorting patterns in matching markets and to estimate the affinity matrix of both the bipartite one-to-one matching model without frictions and with Transferable Utility by 'Dupuy' and 'Galichon' (2014) <doi:10.1086/677191> and its 'unipartite' variant by 'Ciscato', 'Galichon' and 'Gousse' (2020) <doi:10.1086/704611>. It also contains all the necessary tools to implement the 'saliency' analysis, to run rank tests of the affinity matrix and to build tables and plots summarizing the findings.
